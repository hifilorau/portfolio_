    <p>I'm Tom. I am kind of obsessed with how we interface and interact with computers and the web. And more so, how we will interface with them in the future. In a former life I was a professional poker player with over two million dollars in tournament winnings. In college I studied post-colonial literature and jazz performance/composition. It's been a strange trip.</p>

    <p> I've spent the last few years working with startup and expansion stage tech companies. I've done sales, marketing, and project management predominantly. I've had to learn a bit of everything. That said, at heart I'm a product guy who wants to build better ways to do things. I do still find time to play in a bunch of bands and write a few decent stories every year.
